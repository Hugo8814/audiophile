          Reap the advantages of a flat diaphragm tweeter cone. This provides a
          fast response rate and excellent high frequencies that lower tiered
          bookshelf speakers cannot provide. The woofers are made from aluminum
          that produces a unique and clear sound. XLR inputs allow you to
          connect to a mixer for more advanced usage.
