          From the handcrafted microfiber ear cushions to the robust metal
          headband with inner damping element, the components work together to
          deliver comfort and uncompromising sound. Its closed-back design
          delivers up to 27 dB of passive noise cancellation, reducing resonance
          by reflecting sound to a dedicated absorber. For connectivity, a
