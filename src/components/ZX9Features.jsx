          Discover clear, more natural sounding highs than the competition with
          ZX9’s signature planar diaphragm tweeter. Equally important is its
          powerful room-shaking bass courtesy of a 6.5” aluminum alloy bass
          unit. You’ll be able to enjoy equal sound quality whether in a large
          room or small den. Furthermore, you will experience new sensations
          from old songs since it can respond to even the subtle waveforms.
